              <p>
                My full name is Álvaro Palero Ramírez. I'm Peruvian, but I also lived in Florence, Italy, for seven
                years during my childhood. It was there that I developed a deep passion for art and history -
                experiences that shaped me into a perceptive and inquisitive person, always eager to explore and
                understand the world around me.
              </p>
              <p>
                Here in Peru, I studied Mechatronics Engineering and lived many unforgettable experiences as a student.
                During the final years of my degree, I was finally able to dive into robotics and fulfill a long-held
                passion.
              </p>
              <p>
                Every day, I'm working toward building a future in the robotics field, hoping to connect with people
                who, like me, dream big and are driven to make an impact.
